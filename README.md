Manage the WordPress admin menu using a simple drag & drop interface.

## Description ##

At [required+](http://required.ch/ "Team of experienced web professionals from Switzerland & Germany") we strive to create a great user experience. We thought about how to improve the WordPress admin and came to the conclusion that we need a better way to manage the core of the WordPress back-end: the admin menu.

This is our take on a simple, lightweight and unobtrusive WordPress admin menu manager. It works like a charm, doesn’t get in your way and doesn’t even require yet another settings page. So if you want a custom tailored admin menu for you or your clients, this plugin is perfect.

**Pro tip:** Admin Menu Manager works perfectly to get Jetpack out of the way.

You can drag menu items anywhere you want, even from the top level to a sub menu item and vice-versa. Isn’t that awesome?!

**Demo**

Check out this quick [demo video](https://cloudup.com/cJM_wnxhlJo) of the plugin in action.

**Coming Soon**

We’re already working on version 2.0.0 of this plugin, which will ship with many more features. Soon you’ll be able to:

* Completely remove (and restore) menu items
* Edit existing menu items and their icons
* Add custom items to the admin menu
